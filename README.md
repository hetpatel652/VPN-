🌐 CG-NAT (Carrier-Grade NAT)
CG-NAT stands for Carrier-Grade Network Address Translation. It's a technique used by Internet Service Providers (ISPs) to conserve public IPv4 addresses by sharing a single public IP among multiple users.

🧠 How it works:
Every customer has a private IP (like 10.x.x.x or 192.168.x.x).

The ISP uses CG-NAT to map many private IPs to one (or few) public IPs.

This happens on a large NAT gateway maintained by the ISP.

🔧 Why is it used?
IPv4 addresses are limited (only ~4.3 billion). CG-NAT allows ISPs to keep serving more users even with fewer public IPs.

❓ What happens if CG-NAT is enabled and you try to host a VPN server?
Your VPN server likely won't be accessible from the internet.

Why?

🚧 Here's why it breaks:
You don’t have a true public IP.

CG-NAT gives you a shared public IP used by many people.

Your device has only a private IP (like 100.64.x.x or 192.168.x.x).

Port forwarding won't work (Port forwarding is a method used to allow external devices to access services on a private network.)

Even if you open ports on your home router, it won’t matter.

The ISP’s CG-NAT router is in control — you can’t configure it.

Incoming connections to your VPN server get blocked.

The ISP’s NAT device doesn’t know where to forward external requests.

Result: Your VPN server can’t be reached from outside.

💡 Workarounds (if you're stuck behind CG-NAT):
Option	Description
🔁 Reverse SSH/VPN Tunnel	Create a tunnel from your home server to a VPS with a public IP.
☁️ Use a VPS (e.g., AWS, DigitalOcean)	Host your VPN server in the cloud instead.
📞 Ask your ISP for a public IP	Some ISPs offer static or dynamic public IPs for a small fee.
🌍 Use IPv6	If your ISP supports it, host your VPN over IPv6 (no NAT).
